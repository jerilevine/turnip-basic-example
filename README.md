# turnip-basic-example
Extremely basic automation example in Ruby: Conduct a basic search using Google and Capybara with Selenium WebDriver

There are three parts to this example:
1. basic_example: Do a Google Search using just Capybara with Selenium WebDriver, no fancy stuff.
2. page_object_example: Same thing, but refactored using the Page Object pattern.
3. turnip_example: Same thing using Turnip.
